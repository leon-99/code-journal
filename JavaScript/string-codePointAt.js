/*
 Capital characters go first, then a few special ones, then lowercase characters, and `Ã–` near the end of the output.

 Now it becomes obvious why `a > Z`.

 The characters are compared by their numeric code. The greater code means that the character is greater. The code for `a` (97) is greater than the code for `Z` (90).
