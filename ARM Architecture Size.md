### CPU WORD

A word is the size of data that a CPU can process at one time. In ARM architecture, a word is typically 32 bits (4 bytes) or 64 bits (8 bytes), depending on the specific ARM architecture version.

### Memory Size in Gigabytes

To calculate the memory size in gigabytes (GB) for both 32-bit and 64-bit ARM architectures:

- **32-bit ARM Architecture**: 
    - Maximum addressable memory = 2^32 bytes = 4,294,967,296 bytes = 4 GB

- **64-bit ARM Architecture**: 
    - Maximum addressable memory = 2^64 bytes = 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 bytes â‰ˆ 18.4 million TB (terabytes)

Note: The actual usable memory may be less due to system and hardware limitations.
