## Data Structures

### Interface VS Structures

#### Interface
- Specification.
- What data can store.
- What operations are supported and what they mean.

#### Data Structures
- Implementation.
- How data is stored.
- How operations are performed.
- Algorithms to support operations.

### Two Main Interfaces
- Set 
- Sequences [[Static Sequence Interface]] [[Dynamic Sequence Interface]]
